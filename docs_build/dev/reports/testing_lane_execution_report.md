# Testing Lane Execution Report

Generated: 2026-06-05T01:16:40.641Z
Dry run: No

## Summary

PASS: 1
WARN: 0
FAIL: 0
SKIP: 11
Total lane elapsed time: 16.55s
Actual browser launches: 1

## Full Samples Smoke

Status: SKIP
Reason: Skipped because changed files do not modify sample JSON or shared sample loader/framework behavior.

## Preflight

Status: PASS
Reason: Runner preflight and Playwright structure audit passed before expensive lane execution.
