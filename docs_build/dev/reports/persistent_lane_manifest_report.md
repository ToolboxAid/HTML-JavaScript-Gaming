## Fast-Fail Enforcement

- Persisted manifest metadata must match current lane ownership before reuse.
- Lane definition, dependency graph, helper, fixture, import, and targeted-file hashes invalidate stale manifests.
- Invalidated manifests are regenerated deterministically before Playwright/browser launch.
- Persisted manifests never trigger fallback broad discovery.
