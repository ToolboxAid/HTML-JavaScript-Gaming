## Snapshot Validation Findings

No stale graph reuse or snapshot validation blockers were found.

## Invalidation Rules

- Targeted file changes invalidate the owning lane snapshot through manifest input hashes.
- Dependency graph changes invalidate the owning lane snapshot.
- Helper or fixture ownership changes invalidate snapshots that include those graph inputs.
- Lane configuration changes invalidate runtime configuration hashes.
- Runtime configuration changes invalidate execution graph hashes.
- Snapshot invalidation never triggers fallback broad lane regeneration.

## Runtime Savings Observations

- Reused snapshots avoid rebuilding identical targeted lane graphs.
- Snapshot reuse carries lane ownership, manifest, dependency, fixture, helper, and runtime configuration hashes into scheduling.
- Stale snapshots are regenerated deterministically before Playwright/browser launch.
