## Hydration Decisions

| Lane | Status | Helpers | Fixtures | Imports | Dependency Hydration Hash | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tool-images | INVALIDATED | tests/helpers/playwrightRepoServer.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightStorageIsolation.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightV8CoverageReporter.mjs; tests/helpers/workspaceV2CoverageReporter.mjs | none | tests/helpers/playwrightRepoServer.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightStorageIsolation.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightV8CoverageReporter.mjs; tests/helpers/workspaceV2CoverageReporter.mjs; toolbox/toolRegistry.js | b3b85748c9818b68 | Dependency hydration was refreshed after warm-start invalidation. |

## Safeguards

- Dependency hydration reuse is tied to manifest input, ownership, dependency graph, helper, fixture, and import hashes.
- Stale hydration metadata is refreshed before runtime and is not reused silently.
- Hydration invalidation does not trigger fallback broad discovery or unrelated lane execution.
- Reused hydration avoids repeated helper resolution, fixture ownership traversal, and dependency graph hydration for compatible targeted runs.
