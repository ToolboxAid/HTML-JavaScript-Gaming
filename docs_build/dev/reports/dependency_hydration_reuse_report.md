## Safeguards

- Dependency hydration reuse is tied to manifest input, ownership, dependency graph, helper, fixture, and import hashes.
- Stale hydration metadata is refreshed before runtime and is not reused silently.
- Hydration invalidation does not trigger fallback broad discovery or unrelated lane execution.
- Reused hydration avoids repeated helper resolution, fixture ownership traversal, and dependency graph hydration for compatible targeted runs.
