## Manifest-Generated Lane Inputs

| Lane | Ownership | Status | Source | Tests | Helpers | Fixtures | Imports / Dependencies | Dependency Graph Hash | Manifest Hash | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| asset-tool | tools | PASS | generated | tests/playwright/tools/AssetToolMockRepository.spec.mjs | tests/helpers/playwrightRepoServer.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightStorageIsolation.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightV8CoverageReporter.mjs; tests/helpers/workspaceV2CoverageReporter.mjs | none | tests/helpers/playwrightRepoServer.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightStorageIsolation.mjs; tests/helpers/playwrightV8CoverageReporter.mjs; tests/helpers/workspaceV2CoverageReporter.mjs; toolbox/assets/assets-mock-repository.js | 92cab6342b8c5dc0 | 2f179f3229386b61 | Manifest ownership, helpers, fixtures, imports, and command targets are deterministic before runtime. |

## Discovery Expansion Control

Prevented discovery expansion: Yes
Prevented redundant scans: 4
Targeted file/helper reads: 5

## Runtime Savings Observations

- Each selected lane receives one deterministic manifest before runtime scheduling.
- Manifest inputs replace repeated recursive test, helper, and fixture discovery during targeted execution.
- Runtime command targets must be declared by the lane manifest before browser launch.
- Manifest hashes lock lane inputs so runtime lane mutation is detected before execution.
