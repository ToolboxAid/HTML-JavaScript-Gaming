## Runtime Savings Observations

- Zero-browser preflight, lane compilation, and dependency validation run once per targeted runner invocation.
- Reused lane snapshots avoid rebuilding identical targeted execution graphs.
- Validated warm-start lanes reuse deterministic initialization state when manifest and dependency hashes are unchanged.
- Reused dependency hydration avoids repeated helper resolution and fixture ownership traversal for compatible targeted runs.
- Compatible Playwright specs with matching options are kept in shared CLI invocations to avoid redundant browser startup.
- Unselected lanes are not scheduled after isolated targeted lane failures.
- Workspace V2 and samples lanes are not escalated unless explicitly selected.
