The classic arcade game Space Invaders, released in 1978, had a resolution 
of 256x224 pixels. This resolution was typical for many arcade games of that 
era, allowing for a simple yet effective graphical presentation. The game 
displayed monochrome graphics with colored overlays, giving it a distinctive 
look that contributed to its popularity.

Yes, the enemies in Space Invaders had names. The original game featured four 
different types of alien invaders, each with a unique appearance and characteristics:

Squid: The lowest-ranking enemy, usually represented as the most basic form of alien.
Octopus: A slightly tougher enemy that moves faster than the Squid.
Crab: This enemy has a unique appearance and is faster than the Octopus.
UFO: A bonus enemy that appears occasionally, offering additional points when shot down.

Each enemy type had a different point value, with the Squid being worth the least and 
the UFO worth the most. This variety added strategic depth to the game as players 
could prioritize which enemies to target based on their point values and behaviors.

In **Space Invaders**, the point values for the enemies and UFOs can vary based on 
different game versions and specific conditions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the point values:

### Enemy Point Values
- **Squid**: 10 points
- **Octopus**: 20 points
- **Crab**: 30 points
- **Shielded Alien (if applicable in some versions)**: 40 points

### UFO Point Values
- **UFO (Regular)**: 50 points
- **UFO (Bonus)**:
  - Generally worth **100 points**.
  - In some versions, it can be worth **200 points** or more if shot down during specific 
       intervals or conditions, such as:
    - Appearing during a specific round.
    - Being shot down while a player has a certain score.
  
### Variations in Different Versions
- Some remakes or ports of Space Invaders might adjust these values further, introducing 
unique bonuses or multipliers based on player performance, stage progression, or special events.

These point values encourage players to prioritize targets strategically, aiming for the 
higher-scoring enemies while managing the gameplay dynamics.

In the classic **Space Invaders** arcade game, the dimensions of the enemies can vary 
slightly based on the version and platform. However, the original arcade game had the 
following approximate dimensions for each enemy type:

### Enemy Dimensions

1. **Squid**:
   - Width: **24 pixels**
   - Height: **16 pixels**

2. **Octopus**:
   - Width: **24 pixels**
   - Height: **16 pixels**

3. **Crab**:
   - Width: **24 pixels**
   - Height: **16 pixels**

4. **Shielded Alien** (if applicable in some versions):
   - Width: **24 pixels**
   - Height: **16 pixels**

### UFO Dimensions

- **UFO (Regular and Bonus)**:
  - Width: **40 pixels**
  - Height: **16 pixels**

These dimensions are typically in pixel units, as per the graphics used in the 
original game. The consistent height of 16 pixels across the enemies contributes 
to the game's overall design and spacing. Adjustments might be made in modern 
adaptations or remakes, but these values reflect the classic arcade version.


In the classic Space Invaders arcade game, the shields (or bunkers) typically
have dimensions of approximately:

Width: 32 pixels
Height: 16 pixels
The shields are designed as blocks that can vary slightly in shape and appearance,
but these dimensions are a good reference for the standard representation of shields
in the original game. Keep in mind that different versions or adaptations of Space Invaders
might have slightly different shield dimensions.

Here’s the list of objects in **Space Invaders**, along with their typical dimensions:

1. **Player Ship**:
   - **Dimensions**: Approximately **40 pixels wide** by **16 pixels high**.

2. **Invading Aliens**:
   - **Dimensions**: Each alien typically measures around **24 pixels wide** by **16 pixels high**. 
       Different types of aliens may have slightly varying sizes.

3. **UFO**:
   - **Dimensions**: Regular UFOs are often around **50 pixels wide** by **20 pixels high**. 
       Bonus UFOs can vary, but they are typically similar in size.

4. **Shields (Bunkers)**:
   - **Dimensions**: Each shield is usually about **50 pixels wide** by **20 pixels high** and can 
      vary in shape depending on the design.

5. **Missiles**:
   - **Dimensions**: Player missiles are generally around **4 pixels wide** by **8 pixels high**. 
       Alien missiles may be similar or slightly larger.

6. **Game Score Display**:
   - **Dimensions**: The display itself doesn’t have a fixed size but typically spans across the
       top of the screen and is proportional to the game's resolution.

7. **Lives Indicator**:
   - **Dimensions**: The indicator usually consists of several icons (player ships), each approximately
        **16 pixels wide** by **8 pixels high**. The total size depends on how many lives are displayed.

8. **Level Indicator**:
   - **Dimensions**: Like the score display, the level indicator is also proportional to the screen size
        and varies depending on the game resolution.

9. **Background**:
   - **Dimensions**: The background covers the entire game area, matching the game resolution 
       (commonly **256 pixels wide** by **224 pixels high** for classic arcade versions).

These dimensions may vary slightly depending on the specific version or port of Space Invaders,  
    but these values represent common sizes used in many iterations of the game.
