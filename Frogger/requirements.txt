[ ] Scoring System

[ ] 10 points forward movement
[ ] 50 points reaching home
[ ] 200 points all homes filled
[ ] Time bonus
[ ] Fly bonus

Ten points are also awarded per each unused Â½ second of time. 
Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores 200 points each, 
and when all five frogs reach home to end the level 
the player earns 1,000 points. 

A single bonus frog is given at 
20,000 points. 99,990 points is the maximum high score that can be 
achieved on an original arcade cabinet. Players may exceed this score, 
but the game "rolls over" and only keeps the last 5 digits.
