To reverse engineer the 1979 Asteroids game and replicate its controls, mechanics, and overall behavior, you`d need to identify key features and interactions from the original game. Here’s a set of requirements to guide this process:

------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Controls:
[x] Up arrow for thrust  
  Accelerates the ship in the direction it is currently facing.
  
[x] Left arrow for counter-clockwise rotation  
  Rotates the ship to the left (counter-clockwise) around its center.

[x] Right arrow for clockwise rotation  
  Rotates the ship to the right (clockwise) around its center.

[x] Spacebar to fire bullets  
  Fires a bullet from the ship’s current position and direction.

[x] P key (or other key) for pause  
  Pauses the game.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ship Mechanics:
[x] Ship has a forward thrust force  
  When the player holds the thrust key, the ship accelerates forward in the direction it`s facing.
  
[x] Ship has a maximum speed  
  The ship’s speed should not exceed a certain limit, even when thrust is applied.

[x] Ship rotates smoothly  
  Rotation is continuous as long as the corresponding rotation key is pressed.

[x] Ship is affected by inertia  
  When the player stops applying thrust, the ship continues moving in its last direction with decreasing speed due to friction or drag.

[x] Ship should wrap around the screen  
  If the ship goes off one edge, it should appear on the opposite edge.

------------------------------------------------------------

Bullet Mechanics:
[x] Bullets move in the direction the ship is facing  
  Upon firing, the bullet should be shot from the ship’s current position and direction.
  
[x] Bullets have limited lifetime or range  
  Bullets should disappear after traveling a certain distance or after a set amount of time.

[x] Bullets should be destroyed on impact with asteroids/or any object.
  When a bullet hits an asteroid, both the bullet and the asteroid should be destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------

Asteroid Mechanics:
[x] Asteroids spawn in random locations  
  Asteroids should appear on the screen at random positions and velocities.

[x] Asteroids break into smaller pieces  
  When an asteroid is destroyed, it breaks into two 2 smaller asteroids two times.
  Total of 7 asteroids (1 lrg, 2, med, 4 sml)

[x] Asteroids move in a random direction  
  Asteroids should move in random directions and may have a slight spin.

[x] Asteroids should have a limited lifespan  
  After is hit by bullet or ship, the asteroid should be removed from the screen.

------------------------------------------------------------

Collision Detection:
[x] Ship collides with asteroids  
  If the ship comes into contact with an asteroid, the ship should be destroyed or lose a life.

[x] Bullets collide with asteroids  
  Bullets should destroy asteroids when they make contact.

[x] Asteroids collide with each other  
  Asteroids should not pass through each other but instead bounce off one another.

------------------------------------------------------------

Game Progression:
[x] Player has a limited number of lives  
  The player starts with a set number of lives (e.g., 3), and when all are lost, the game ends.

[x] Score is tracked  
  The player earns points for destroying asteroids and other in-game actions.

[x] Difficulty increases with progression  
  As the player destroys more asteroids, the game should increase in difficulty (e.g., more asteroids, faster speed).

[x] Game reset or new game option  
  After losing all lives or completing the game, the player should be able to start a new game.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sound and Visual Effects:
[ ] Thrust sound effect when the ship accelerates  
  A distinct sound should play when the ship moves forward.

[X] Bullet sound effect when the ship fires  
  A unique sound effect should play when the player shoots a bullet.

[x] Asteroid destruction sound effect  
  A specific sound should play when an asteroid is destroyed by a bullet.

[x] Ship destruction sound effect  
  A different sound should play when the ship collides with an asteroid.

[!] Background music and ambient sound  
  There should be a looping background track with space-like ambient sounds.

------------------------------------------------------------

Visuals:
[x] Vector graphics for ship and asteroids  
  The original game used simple, vector-based graphics for ship and asteroid rendering.

[!] Simple explosions for ship and asteroid destruction  
  When asteroids are destroyed or the ship is hit, an explosion animation should play.

[ ] Screen shake or flash when the ship is hit  
  To show the ship has been hit, there could be a screen shake or visual effect.

[x] HUD elements: score, lives, and level  
  Display the player’s current score, number of remaining lives, and current level.

------------------------------------------------------------

Game Modes:
[ ] Single-player mode  
  The game should support a single-player experience with one player controlling the ship.

[ ] No multiplayer required  
  The original game is a single-player experience.

------------------------------------------------------------
Now the UFO, most challenging:
------------------------------------------------------------

 UFO Mechanics:
[ ] Random UFO appearance  
  UFOs should randomly spawn at the edges of the screen at set intervals or after certain milestones (e.g., a specific score threshold or destroyed asteroid count).

[ ] Two types of UFOs  
  Include large UFOs (less accurate, more points) and small UFOs (more accurate, fewer points).

[ ] UFO movement across the screen  
  UFOs should move horizontally across the screen (left-to-right or right-to-left) and can slightly adjust their vertical position over time.

[ ] UFOs wrap around the screen  
  If a UFO goes off one edge, it should reappear on the opposite edge (similar to the ship).

------------------------------------------------------------

 UFO Shooting Mechanics:
[ ] UFOs fire bullets randomly  
  UFOs should fire bullets at random intervals (e.g., every 1-3 seconds).

[ ] Bullets target the player (small UFO)  
  Small UFOs aim their bullets directly at the player’s ship with high accuracy.

[ ] Bullets fire randomly (large UFO)  
  Large UFOs fire bullets in random directions, making them less accurate.

[ ] Bullet lifespan  
  UFO bullets should have a limited range or lifespan, disappearing after traveling a certain distance.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Collision Detection (UFOs):
[ ] UFOs are destroyed by player bullets  
  If a player’s bullet hits a UFO, the UFO should be destroyed, awarding points to the player.

[ ] UFO bullets collide with the player’s ship  
  If a UFO’s bullet hits the player’s ship, the ship should be destroyed or lose a life.

[ ] UFOs do not collide with asteroids  
  UFOs should move through asteroids without interacting with them.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Scoring for UFOs:
[ ] Higher points for smaller UFOs  
  Small UFOs should award more points when destroyed (e.g., 1,000 points).

[ ] Lower points for larger UFOs  
  Large UFOs should award fewer points when destroyed (e.g., 200-500 points).

------------------------------------------------------------

 Sound Effects for UFOs:
[ ] Distinct UFO sound effect  
  UFOs should have a recognizable sound effect when present, such as a continuous, ominous "whirring" or "beeping."

[ ] Unique firing sound  
  UFO bullets should have a distinct sound effect different from the player`s bullets.

[ ] Explosion sound effect  
  A unique sound should play when a UFO is destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Game Progression with UFOs:
[ ] UFO frequency increases over time  
  As the game progresses, UFOs should spawn more frequently and possibly fire faster or move more unpredictably.

[ ] UFOs as high-risk/high-reward targets  
  While UFOs can provide significant points, they also increase the risk of losing a life due to their bullets.

[ ] Only one UFO at a time  
  To maintain balance, there should only be one UFO on the screen at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Visual Design for UFOs:
[ ] Distinct vector-based UFO shapes  
  Large UFOs and small UFOs should have distinct but simple designs to differentiate them visually.

[ ] UFO size difference  
  Small UFOs should appear noticeably smaller than large UFOs.

[ ] UFO bullets are unique  
  UFO bullets should have a different appearance from the player’s bullets to make them easy to identify.

------------------------------------------------------------

 UFO Difficulty Scaling:
[ ] Small UFO accuracy increases over time  
  As the game progresses, small UFOs should become more accurate in targeting the player.

[ ] Faster UFOs at higher levels  
  UFOs should move more quickly as the game’s difficulty increases.

[ ] Variable bullet speed  
  UFO bullets should gradually increase in speed at higher levels.
